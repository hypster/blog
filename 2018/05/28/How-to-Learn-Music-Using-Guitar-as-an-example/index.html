        <p>Today we are going to talk generally of how to study music, in particular, how to become a better improviser.</p>
<p>Like many players online, I learned guitar without formal education. Even though I am not a very mature player, lacking time being the most important reason. I think now I have gained a very good understanding of how to study music. As I have heard the gypsies learn music through their mother, even though most of women don’t play music, they have very good understanding of music, I think I am in such a position…</p>
<p>I am only going to give some generous advices today, but if you follow them, you will become a good improviser.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Learning the fretboard.</p>
<p>Learning the fretboard means learning the notes on the fret. You don’t need to remember them all at one time, but if you make concious recalls during practice session, you will get more and more familiar with the fretboard. </p>
<p>Even guitar navigation is largely based on shape, knowing the note names can greatly ease your mind when you solo. The natural notes(no flats and sharps) are like anchor points on the neck, and you can slip into other sharp/flat notes quite easily.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Get familiar with most arpeggio shapes.</p>
<p>This includes major, minor and dominant. If you have familiar with them, you can always add extension later, such as minor6, major9 etc. </p>
<p>If you found some of the fingerings too difficult to play, do not get too meticulous! Think other routes to navigate on the fretboard(Think Django!).</p>
<p>And talking about shapes, I am really a believer of starting  simple. A triad or even a diad is all you need to get start soloing. Many players start solo using pentatonics or even the natural scales. They try to learn all the shapes all at one time, but fail to use them properly during the actual solo. If we can start simple, and build on top of that, then you can quickly enrich your solo vocabulary. Remember the right sequence: triad -&gt; pentatonics -&gt; natural scale -&gt; scale with altered sound. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Learn the right way to pick the string.</p>
<p>Guitar, with no doubt, can be considered as a very modern instrument. It has lead genres such as blues, metal and some of the fusion music. But sometimes we only want to play good melodies! When you try to alternate pick every time, you will find that you lost some important things in the music. Consider the following scenario: You play hard on the off beat, and you play lightly on the strong beat, even though you found your playing to be more and more modern with more and more altered notes, but is that really what you had wanted the first time you pick the instrument? Recall the nice melodies you heard in your childhood, be it is a nursery rhyme or christmas song, can you really play those songs the way you would passionately sing back then? If I would recommend, I would suggest you to learn the manouche style. Or rather, to unlearn all the picking methods and terms you have been imbued with: the economy picking, the cycle picking, the tremelo picking. You don’t need all these things to play guitar, just follow the music! Remember, it should always be the melody that dictates how you should pick the string! When you have fully understand this, you will find that you have brought back guitar to our traditional music instrument family. It can play the melodies as beatifully as any other traditional instrument, be it an ober or a violin.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Transcribe music as early as possible</p>
<p>It can’t be overemphasized how transcribing music helps accumulating the solo vocabularies. Get rid of all those boring theory books! In order to play good music, the most important thing is to listen to good music you like and transcribe them! While practicing II IV I is certainly important, you need to listen the full solos being developed, because a good solo is usually very narrative, If you only try to stuff random licks into some passages, it would usually sound very out of place. You need to develop a habbit of transcribing music so that those essential elements of good melodies gradually get into your heart.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Practice the rhythm section.</p>
<p>As a Otaku(home bed) player, you lack the opportunity of cooperating with others. If you play the rhythm while playing the solos of those masterers you admire, you will quickly differentiate the important notes on the chords, and get a very organic understanding of solo motives. A good accompanist can’t be a bad improviser! When you have played many types of rhythms and chord progressions, believe me, you will form a good understanding of what consists of a good solo.</p>
</li>
</ul>
